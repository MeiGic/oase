<h1>Scandit SDK 4.0 for iOS</h1>

<p>New Features:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Blurry Code39/Code128 Support: This latest release of the Scandit SDK features an advanced Code39/Code128 barcode decoder that can decode blurry Code39/Code128 barcodes resulting from out-of-focus camera images or fixed-focus cameras. Since this new feature requires more computing resources, we recommend that you switch off the Code39/Code128 decoder if you are not using it in your app.</p></li>
<li><p>GS1 Databar Support: Starting with Scandit SDK 4.0.0, we support GS1 Databar barcodes. This includes support for omnidirectional, omnidirectional stacked, expanded, expanded stacked and truncated GS1-Databar barcodes. The GS1 Databar support is disabled by default.</p></li>
<li><p>Added new method stopScanningAndFreeze which stops the barcode scanning and also halts the camera preview. The default stopScanning method does not halt the camera preview and thus accelerates subsequent barcode scans.</p></li>
<li><p>QR Codes of version 1 are now also decoded when placed at an angle to the camera.</p></li>
<li><p>Added ARM64 slice for iPhone 5S.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Important changes:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The new CODE39/CODE128 decoder in 4.0.0 requires more computing resources than the old CODE39/CODE128 decoder. We recommend that you switch off the Code39/CODE128 decoder if you are not using it in your app.  </p></li>
<li><p>The minimum deployment target is now 5.1.1 (was 5.0) due the ARM64 slice. If you do not build for ARM64 and only use the armv7 and armv7s slices, 5.0 can still be used as a deployment target.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Known Issues (will be fixed in one of the next releases):</p>

<ul>
<li>On iOS7 devices, the autofocus is configured to only focus on objects close to the camera. We will offer a new feature in the next release to disable this macro mode for scenarios where (large) 1D and 2D codes need to be scanned from further away.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Bug fixes/Software Updates in 4.0.1 (May 12th, 2014)</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>Fixed bug that led to crash or failed decode when Code39 barcode was more than 17 characters long.</p></li>
<li><p>Reduced memory footprint of Scandit Barcode Scanner SDK</p></li>
<li><p>Fixed the search bar offset in landscapeLeft and portraitUpsideDown.</p></li>
<li><p>Fixed an issues where armv7 and armv7s required deployment target 5.1.1 (after adding arm64 slice). This new version
uses a deployment target of iOS 5.0 for armv7 and armv7s.</p></li>
<li><p>Added x86_64 architecture for iOS simulators.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Bug fixes in 4.0.0 (March 24th, 2014)</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>Fixed bug that prevented small data matrix codes to be decoded in the micro data matrix mode. This bug was introduced in 3.1.0.</p></li>
<li><p>Fixed QR code highlighting which was off in some cases.</p></li>
<li><p>Fixed bug that led to crash, when iOS device did not make video feed available.</p></li>
<li><p>Fixed bug in previous release where GS1-Datamatrix codes were reported with a leading FNC1. This leading FNC1 is now again removed.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Bug fixes in 3.2.3. (December, 18th 2013)</h2>

<ul>
<li>Software update to eliminate an additional minor memory leak.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Bug fixes in 3.2.2. (December, 16hth 2013)</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>Software update to remove two minor memory leaks.</p></li>
<li><p>Software update to deactivate macro mode when Scandit SDK releases the camera. The Scandit SDK activates the macro mode in the camera and, when an UIImagePicker is started subsequently in the app, the macro mode of the camera remained activated in previous releases and could not be deactivated unless the app is sent to the background.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Bug fixes in 3.2.1 (November, 22th 2013)</h2>

<ul>
<li>Fixed issue that led to app crash whenever picker was presented as view controller (and
not as subview) under iOS7.0.* and in combination with a certain state of the view hierarchy. In our test setup, we could reproduce this crash only when a MKMapView was present in the view hierarchy (other view configurations might possibly also cause this crash though).</li>
</ul>

<h2>Bug fixes in 3.2.0 (November, 1st 2013)</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>Fixed issue that caused unwanted, duplicate scans when scanning multiple barcodes sequentially on latest
generation iOS devices</p></li>
<li><p>Fixed issue that caused barcode highlighting to be slightly off on some iOS devices.</p></li>
<li><p>Fixed bug where QR codes with large module size covering the entire screen were not decoded.</p></li>
<li><p>Software update of demo apps to use automatic reference counting.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Scandit SDK 3.2.0</h2>

<p>New Features:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Better PDF417 decoding (no longer in beta): We implemented a more sophisticated PDf417 decoder
that is capable of decoding PDF417 barcodes with tiny features such as those PDF417 codes found on
US driving licenses. (The PDF417 decoder is disabled by default).</p></li>
<li><p>Better ITF/Code39/Code128/QR decoding: We improved the decoding performance of these decoders to have better
dynamic range.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Bug fixes in 3.1.1 (September, 27th 2013)</h2>

<ul>
<li>Bug fix to address problem in 3.1.0 where setOverlayController method of ScanditSDKBarcodePicker was not working.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Bug fixes in 3.1.0 (September, 26th 2013)</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>Software update to the search bar implementation. Under iOS7, it is no longer possible to dynamically change the caption
of the search bar (from "Cancel" -> "Go"). We added a "Search" button to the keyboard. The language of the "Cancel" button caption is
now automatically updated based on the language set by the user.</p></li>
<li><p>Fixed bug where barcodes where not always correctly highlighted in the scan user interface.</p></li>
<li><p>Fixed bug where didScanBarcode was occasionally called twice.</p></li>
<li><p>Increased frame rate for iPhone devices such as the iPhone 5, 4 and 4S. In previous bug fix release 3.0.4 we reduced the frame rate to prevent distortion issue on iPads. This reduction led to a sluggish user interface on devices such as the iPhone4.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Scandit SDK 3.1.0</h2>

<p>New Features:</p>

<p>Scandit SDK 3.1.* features a number of improvements to the overall scanning
performance. We recommend that you upgrade as soon as possible to take advantage of the better
scan performance - in particular because of the better autofocus control with iOS7.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Better Autofocus Control: Scandit SDK 3.1 takes advantage of the APIs in iOS7 that
allow for better control of the autofocus.</p></li>
<li><p>Better Blurry Barcode Localization: In 3.0, we introduced full screen barcode detection
and decoding, but blurry barcodes were not always reliable detected when off-center. Scandit SDK 3.1
provides a novel barcode localization algorithm that also detects blurry barcodes.</p></li>
<li><p>Better Blurry Decoding: In Scandit SDK 3.1, we improved the scan performance with fixed focus cameras, e.g. the iPad3' front-facing camera.</p></li>
<li><p>New Demo Apps: We replaced the old demo app with two new demo apps. The first demo app only shows the
minimal steps necessary to run the Scandit SDK. The second new demo app has a new view that lists
all the settings of the Scandit API. Developers can now experiment with the different features in the app before
they use them themselves in their own apps.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Important Changes:</p>

<ul>
<li>In iOS7, the camera preview is no longer added below the status bar or navigation bar
but the two ui elements are overlays. If you are restricting the area where barcodes are scanned via
the restrictActiveScanningArea and you are adding your own custom overlay to instruct the user where to align
the barcode, you will need to take care that the active scanning area of the Scandit SDK decoder
(controlled via the hotspot) is aligned with the target area suggested by your overlay.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Bug fixes in 3.0.4 (August 2nd, 2013)</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>Fixed issue where rapid allocation and deallocation of ScanditSDKBarcodePicker could lead to app crash for
some view controller configurations.</p></li>
<li><p>Fixed issue in new full image barcode detection algorithm that could lead to rare app crashes when camera image
featured particular repetitive texture.</p></li>
<li><p>Enabled camera switch for tablets in Scandit SDK demo app.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Bug fixes in 3.0.3 (July 17th, 2013 - available as enterprise trial only)</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>Fixed issue where camera image was slightly distorted on iPad devices.</p></li>
<li><p>Fixed issue where previously set1DEnabled would not enable MSIPlessey Decoder and set2DEnabled would
not enable PDF417 decoder.</p></li>
<li><p>Software update to decode blurry barcodes that upside down in the camera image.</p></li>
<li><p>Fixed issue where barcode highlighting in camera image was slightly off on some iOS devices.</p></li>
<li><p>Fixed issue where orientation changes would freeze camera when the scanning area was restricted via the
"restrictActiveScanningArea" method.</p></li>
<li><p>Software update to switch off the "StandBy" state introduced in 3.0.0. The Scandit SDK enters this
StandBy state by default after a successful scan because it makes subsequent scanner starts
significantly faster. This "StandBy" State requires additional resources (power, memory) though and
can be disabled by calling disableStandbyState on the picker.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Bug fixes in 3.0.2:</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>Fixed a bug in the memory management of the ScanditSDKBarcodePicker where the release of the
picker object could interfere with the instantiation of a new picker object. This could have been
the cause of problems with ARC in 3.0.0 and 3.0.1.  </p></li>
<li><p>Fixed a bug where the reset of the viewfinder and the viewfinder animation was not
working correctly.</p></li>
<li><p>Fixed a bug in implementation of ScanditSDKNextFrameDelegate protocol that was not working
since the 3.0.0 update.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Bug fixes in 3.0.1:</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>Updated ScanditSDKRotatingBarcodePicker to also access iphone settings if ipad ones arent available when
retrieving supportedInterfaceOrientations.</p></li>
<li><p>Removed duplicate header entry that caused warning message in Xcode.</p></li>
<li><p>Fixed bug where white viewfinder rectangle in the scan UI was jumping between different barcode locations
when barcode is in vertical orientation.</p></li>
<li><p>Fixed bug where white viewfinder rectangle changed size when presented as navigation controller and the user
changed orientation from portrait to landscape and back to portrait.</p></li>
<li><p>Fixed a bug which did not allow the picker to be locked into a non-portrait orientation.</p></li>
<li><p>Added a method to maintain the torch state in between successful scans. The current default implementation
of stopScanning switches the torch off. The new method is called stopScanningAndKeepTorchState.</p></li>
<li><p>Fixed a small bug in the torch implementation. Previously, the user had to tap the icon twice after a previous "stop torch" command.</p></li>
<li><p>Fixed a viewfinder resizing issue when an iPhone is turned from portrait to landscape back to portrait.</p></li>
<li><p>Fixed a bug where the cancel button would not respond on iPads in landscape mode when the ScanditSDKBarcodePicker was presented modally.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Scandit SDK 3.0.0</h2>

<p>New Features:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>full screen scanning: In Scandit SDK 2.*, the user had to place the barcode in the
 center of the camera image. In this new release, barcodes are detected and decoded in
 the entire camera image.</p></li>
<li><p>improved autofocus management: We improved the camera control which means that the
 camera properties (such as focus) are maintained over successive barcode scans. This new
 feature makes a big difference if you are planning on scanning multiple barcodes in
 sequence.</p></li>
<li><p>better scan performance and robustness: We further improved our blurry barcode decoding
 algorithms so that even the very blurry images of an iPhone 5 (before the autofocus is
 activated) are now decoded.</p></li>
<li><p>new cleaner scan screen interface with the option to add a button to switch cameras
 (from the front to the back camera)</p></li>
<li><p>new symbologies: beta support for PDF417 and MSI Plessey.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Important changes:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The Scandit SDK starts by default in full screen scanning mode. If you want to only scan barcodes
in a restricted area of the camera image, you should call the "restrictActiveScanningArea" method of
the ScanditSDKBarcodePicker.</p></li>
<li><p>Scandit SDK 3.* requires a new iOS framework: libc++. To add the library, select your
target in Xcode, choose build phases and add the library under the "Link Binary With Libraries" entry.</p></li>
<li><p>In 3.0+, we only support iOS devices with iOS 5.0 and higher. If you need need iOS 4.3 support,
using Scandit SDK 2.0+ for iOS.</p></li>
<li><p>In 3.0+, we no longer support the iPhone 3G. If you need iPhone 3G support, we recommend
using Scandit SDK 2.0+ for iOS.</p></li>
<li><p>Access to the methods that are available for scan screen customization has been
restricted for users of our free Community edition. They remain available for our
enterprise customers. Moving forward we want apps using our free community
edition to have a common scan screen user interface that promotes our Scandit brand.</p></li>
</ul>
